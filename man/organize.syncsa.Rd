\title{Function for organize data for Package SYNCSA}
\usage{
organize.syncsa(comm, traits = NULL, dist.spp = NULL, envir = NULL,
  strata = NULL, check.comm = TRUE, convert.traits = FALSE,
  ord = "metric")
}
\arguments{
\item{comm}{Community data, with species as columns and sampling units as
rows.}

\item{traits}{Matrix data of species described by traits, with traits as
columns and species as rows (Default traits = NULL).}

\item{dist.spp}{Matrix containing phylogenetic distance between species.
Must be a complete matrix (not a half diagonal matrix).This matrix can be
larger than community data (more species) as long as it has at least all
species that are in community data (Default dist.spp = NULL).}

\item{envir}{Environmental variables for each community, with variables as
columns and sampling units as rows (Default envir = NULL).}

\item{strata}{Strata nomed vector to specify restricting permutations within
species groups (Default strata = NULL).}

\item{check.comm}{Logical argument (TRUE or FALSE) to remove sampling units and 
species with total sums equal or less than zero (Default check.comm = "TRUE").}

\item{convert.traits}{Logical argument (TRUE or FALSE) to convert factor traits in 
dummy traits and/or convert ordinal variables in numeric (see ord option) (Default convert.traits = FALSE).}

\item{ord}{Method to be used for ordinal variables, see \code{\link{gowdis}}.
When ord = "podani" or ord = "metric", all ordered variable are replaced by their ranks
and if ord = "classic" all ordinal variables are simply treated as continuous variables
(Default ord = "metric").}
}
\value{
The dataframes or matrices of community, traits, phylogenetic distance and
environmental variables, as well as the type of each varible in each dataframe or matrix. 
The strata vector for permutations. If convert.traits is TRUE and some traits is of class
factor the function returm the traits with expand traits in dummy variables and return 
a list with sugestion to group of traits that are analysed together. If some warning messenger
is showed a list of warning messenger is returned.
}
\description{
Package \strong{SYNCSA} requires that the species and community sequence in
the dataframe or matrix must be the same for all dataframe/matrices.
}
\details{
The function organizes the data for the functions of the package
\strong{SYNCSA}, placing the matrices of community, traits, phylogenetic
distance and environmental varibles in the same order.
}
\note{
The function organizes the data despite the absence of one of the
dataframes or matrices, provided that the community data had been entered. Unspecified
data will appear as NULL.
